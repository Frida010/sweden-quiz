# Sweden Quiz

The Sweden Quiz is a website were you can play a quiz game and all the questions are about Sweden. The quiz tests your knowledge about the land in the far north.

At the end of the game the user will get a score of how many points the person got in total.

The website contains a header and a footer. The footer contains icons whit links to social media.

## Features

#### - Header

- Featured at the top at the page is the header. The header does not have any features it does only display the name, and that makes it clear for the user what game they are playing.
- I think the header creates a nice contrast on this game's website and that why I choose to make it.
- The font have a playful look and fits the caracter of the website well.

#### - The Quiz

- The quiz has a yellow border that frames the quiz area.
- The quiz area have one question and four options for the user to choose from.
- The buttons have a hover effect that lights up the button the user hovers over.

### Features left to implement
