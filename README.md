# Sweden Quiz

The Sweden Quiz is a quiz game and all questions are all about Sweden. The quiz tests your knowledge about the land in the far north. The questions are funny and have unusual twists.

Users of this website will be able to play a quiz game about Sweden and at the end of the game the user will get a score of how many points the person got in total.

The website contains a header and a footer. The footer contains icons whit links to social media.

## Features


#### - Header

- Featured at the top at the page is the header. The header does not have any features it does only displayes the name, and that makes it clear for the user what game they are playing.
- I think the header creates a nice contrast on this game's website and that why I choose to make it.
- The font have a playful look and fits the caracter of the website well.
