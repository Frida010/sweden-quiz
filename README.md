# Sweden Quiz

The Sweden Quiz is a quiz game and all questions are all about Sweden. The quiz tests your knowledge about the land in the far north. The questions are funny and medium hard. 

Users of this website will be able to play a quiz game about Sweden and at the end of the game the user will get a score of how many points the person got in total.

The website contains a header and a footer. The footer contains icons whit links to social media.

## Features

#### - Header

- Featured at the top at the page is the header. The header does not have any features it does only displayes the name, and that makes it clear for the user what game they are playing.
- I think the header creates a nice contrast on this game's website and that why I choose to make it.

#### - The Quiz

- The quiz has a yellow border that frames the quiz area.
- The quiz area has one question and four options for the user to choose from.
- The buttons have a hover effect that lights up the button the user hovers over.
- When the user has made a decision the button with the rigth answer will light up in a green color and the wrong answer in a red color.
- When a choise is made, a button whit the text "Next" will appear for the user to click on and get to the next question. 
- When the quiz is over and all questions is answerd, the user will get a message saying "You scored ... out of 6!" 
- On this last page the button will also have changed and have a text saying "Play Again" and now the user can make the choise to play again.  

#### - Footer section

- The footer contains clickable social media links for the user to find the company on facebook and instagram.
- The footer also contains the text "Share your results whit us on social media!" to invite the user to interact.
